Standard serial port protocol.  All commands are terminated with <cr><lf> (\r\n)

known commands:
STATUS? - Get status (see status flags below)
ISET1? - Get realtime current limit value
VSET1? - Get realtime voltage limit value
IOUT1? - Get realtime current output value
VOUT1? - Get realtime voltage output value
*IDN? - Device ID? (returns "QJE3005PV1.0")
VSET1:nn.nn - Set voltage limit (max 30.00?)
ISET1:n.nnn - Set current (max 5.200)
OUTPUT0 - Disable output
OUTPUT1 - Enable output


Status appears to be a read only value of status flags.  It contains 3 flag values: ABC
A = 0 = Constant Current Mode
A = 1 = Constant Voltage Mode
B = 0 = Output Off
B = 1 = Output on
C = 0 = OCP OK
C = 1 = Over Current Protection (OCP) tripped

Observed return status values:
xxx - When the device doesn't respond to "STATUS?\r\n" means device not connected or not communicating
000 - When device first connects and no data has been sent to device, it returns this status
001 - Over Current Protection tripped, all output off
010 - Constant Current, output on
110 - Constant Voltage, output on
100 - Constant Voltage, output off

In other words, possible values are:
*OCP OK*
00 - output off
01 - output on
10 - output off
11 - output on

*OCP TRIPPED*
001


When the tekpower software first connects to the device, it sends the following data over serial:
ISET1?\r\nVSET1?\r\nSTATUS?\r\n

This translates to: What is the current limit set to? What is the voltage limit set to? What is your status?

If the status returned is either 01 or 11, the output is on and the software will continuously send:
IOUT1?\r\nVOUT1?\r\nSTATUS?\r\n
In a loop every 500ms or so. This translates to:

What is the realtime current output? what is the realtime voltage output? what is your status?

The software uses the return values from these commands to update the software display.

The output can be toggled by sending either "OUTPUT1\r\n" or "OUTPUT0\r\n" to toggle the output on/off.

When the status indicates the output is off, the software will continuously send:
STATUS?\r\n
In a loop every 500ms or so, to monitor the status of the device.


*OVERCURRENT PROTECTION*
There appears to be no command available to SET or GET the current value of the OCP.  The only thing we can
know about the OCP is whether it is tripped or not, through the status flag value xx0 (OCP OK) or xx1 (OCP TRIP)

HOWEVER, it is possible to set a *SOFT* OCP in software. While monitoring the realtime current output,
the output can be disabled if the realtime current output goes over a specified value.

In this manner, a *SOFT* OVP can also be configured.

Therefore, it is recommended to set the OCP protection on the device PRIOR to connecting your computer to
its maximum value. For TekPower TP3005P, this seems to be 5.200 amps.  This way, you can set *SOFT* OCP
to any value below 5.200 amps. If, somehow, the current ever goes over 5.200 amps, the hardware OCP will
kick in, and the status will indicate that the OCP has been triggered.

When receiving data from the device, the device will send '\n' to signal the end of data.
